PAGINATION:
    dive the information in different pages.
    dive tons of information into multiple parts.

USAGE:
    we could apply globally using settings configurations:
        'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination',
        'PAGE_SIZE': 100

CUSTOM:
    - as you have learned you can create your own configurations.
    - you can create your Custom pagination class. Create the file pagination. Create a new class with a intuitive name tha inherits from the type of pagination you want to utilize:
        - PageNumberPagination
        - LimitOffsetPagination

OFFSET AND LIMIT:
    - offset indicates the starting position of the query.
    - limit indicate the maximum number of items to return.
    - let's suppose we have 100 items. we define a offset of 50 and a limit of ten. we'll be getting - - first items after the 50 item

CURSOR:
    Client get more results as they scroll down.
    you just have access to next and previous.
    ordering is required:
        by default ordering is the creating time.
    when creating a cursor pagination it is required to define an ordering system but you can run into an error you have define an ordering filter.
