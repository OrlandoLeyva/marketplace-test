Filtering helps us to extract the correct information based on certain user requirements, such as date, price, category, etc.

We got to import a package that will help us to perform this task:
    pip install django-filter
    add django_filters to installed apps
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': ['django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend']
} # If you want to apply it to all the view classes
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]

NOTE: DJANGO FILTERING WILL ONLY WORK ON GENERIC VIEWS.

FILTERING:
    - Once the configuration is done, we need to specify according which filed we want to filter:
        filterset_fields

FILTERING VS SEARCHING:
    filtering has be a exact math, unlike searching.
