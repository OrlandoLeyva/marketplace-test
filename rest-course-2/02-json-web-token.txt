Json web token is used to transmit information between parties. It is a json encode and signed.

PACKAGE:
    djangorestframework-simplejwt

USAGE:
    install the PACKAGE
    add the necessary configuration

NOTES:
    when sending the jwt you need to use the keyword Bearer and when sending the refresh jwt you got user refresh instead.
    That was not actually correct. You need to use form-encoded and send a refresh property with the token

If you want the system returns you an access token and a refresh token when you're refreshing the token you need to include some extra configuration to the settings file.

SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True
}
